        <p "align="left">A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts data (input), processes it according to a set of instructions (software), produces output, and can store information for future use. It consists of hardware (physical components like the CPU, memory, and peripherals) and software (the instructions that control the hardware) and relies on a binary (0s and 1s) system to perform tasks, from simple calculations to complex operations. Modern computers come in many sizes, including desktops, laptops, and smartphones, all designed to execute a broad range of tasks.</p>
    <h1 align="center" >cpu</h1>
    <p style="color:red"aling="left">A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the "brain" of a computer, executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing data flow between hardware and software. It interprets commands, runs the operating system and applications, and handles tasks like arithmetic and logic operations. Key components of a CPU include the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for calculations, the Control Unit (CU) for instruction management, and a Memory Unit for temporary data storage. CPUs are found in nearly all computing devices, from desktops and servers to smartphones and smart appliances.</p>
