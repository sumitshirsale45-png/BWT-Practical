        <h2>Section 1: compass</h2>
        <p>A compass is a navigational instrument that uses Earth's magnetic field to show direction, commonly featuring a magnetized needle that aligns with the North and South magnetic poles</p>
        <p> It displays the cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) on a compass rose and is used for orientation, navigation, and surveying. The Earth's molten core creates a magnetic field, and a compass's free-moving magnetic needle detects this field, allowing a user to determine their direction and navigate with it.  
How a Compass Works
Earth's Magnetic Field: The Earth acts like a giant magnet with a magnetic field extending from the North to the South magnetic pole. 
Magnetized Needle: The core of a compass is a magnetized needle, usually made of steel, that is balanced on a pivot to move freely. 
Alignment: When the compass is held level, the needle detects the Earth's magnetic field and aligns itself to point towards the magnetic north pole. 
Directional Reading: The compass has a compass rose or dial with markings for the cardinal directions (N, E, S, W) and often intermediate directions (NE, SE, SW, NW). 
Using the Compass: By seeing where the needle points in relation to these directions, the user can determine their direction of travel and find their way.

        <h2>Section 2: history of compass</h2>
        <p>The magnetic compass was invented in ancient China, initially for divination and later adapted for land and maritime navigation by the Song dynasty. Chinese inventors developed the "South Pointing Fish" and magnetized needles using lodestone. Knowledge of the compass spread to Europe and the Islamic world by the 12th and 13th centuries, where it was documented and further developed. European innovations included the dry compass and the liquid-filled compass in the early 20th century, which increased accuracy and practicality.</p>

        <h2>Section 3: Now day compass</h2>
        <p>Today, the term "compass" often refers to the digital compass app on a smartphone, which uses the phone's built-in magnetic sensor to find directions, though physical magnetic compasses remain in use for outdoor navigation and specific fields like aviation and shipping. While smartphone compass apps provide convenience, traditional compasses offer higher accuracy in certain situations and are essential for some activities where technology fails</p>
