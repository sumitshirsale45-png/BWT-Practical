            <b>A compass is a navigation tool that uses a magnetized needle to align with the Earth's magnetic field, pointing to magnetic north and helping users determine cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) and navigate geographic locations</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i> It consists of a compass rose showing directions and often degree markings for more precise orientation.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <u> Though anciently used in China for divination, its primary modern use is for navigation, especially when GPS or other technology isn't available.</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            A compass relies on the <sub>Earth's magnetic</sub> field. The Earth acts like a giant magnet with a north and south magnetic pole. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside the compass is a <sup>magnetized</sup> needle or element. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This needle is free to <del>rotate </del>and will naturally align itself with the Earth's magnetic field, with one end always pointing toward the magnetic north pole. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The compass <ins>shows these directions</ins> on a compass rose, which has markings for the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) and often ordinal directions (NE, SE, SW, NW). 
        </p>

            <pre>Key Components
                Magnetized Needle:
                The primary component that indicates direction. </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
           <mark>Compass Rose</mark> :A diagram showing the cardinal and ordinal directions, often with letters like N, S, E, and W. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <kbd>Displays degree markings</kbd>, with North typically at 0 degrees and increasing clockwise (East = 90°, South = 180°, West = 270°). 
        </p>
        <p>
            A protective housing, <dfn>often made of plastic or metal</dfn>, that holds the components together.

             <q>Essential for orienting a map and following routes accurately. </q>
